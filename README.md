## Full Winsock and ICMP wrapper DLL


</div>

### Description

This project is an attempt to create an easy to use DLL, which will allow your programs to connect to the Internet. It makes use of the Winsock API functions and the ICMP API functions, as well as various other Kernel32 API functions, to allow you to easily connect to other computers, and allow other computers to connect to you. Once a connection has been established, the DLL allows data to be sent and received and information about the local and the remote end of the connection to be gained. There is also a feature in the DLL that will allow your programs to send a PING, connected or not.
